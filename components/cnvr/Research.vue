      I chose the “Ban Luang Phra To-Tha Lian” community (Hua Takheo - ชุมชนหัวตะเข้) for my study.
      This area has a stray dog problem and many people, including locals and tourists from the
      nearby floating market. I will interview residents and observe the situation to learn more.

      From my observation and interviews, I learned that officials provide dog neutering services
      using the CNVR method. Dogs are either caught or brought by community members to specific
      locations on scheduled dates. After neutering, the dogs are returned to their original areas.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-8 text-cnvr">
      This led me to interview the officials responsible for the CNVR process. From them, I learned
      about the challenges they face in managing and implementing the program effectively.
