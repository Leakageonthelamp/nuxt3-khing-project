    <p class="mt-6">
      This project was my first hands-on experience with the UX process, and it has been both
      memorable and full of learning. While not perfect, it taught me valuable lessons and helped me
      realize the type of work I truly enjoy. I discovered a passion for talking to people,
      brainstorming creative ideas, and designing solutions that enhance user experiences or help
      solve problems effectively.
