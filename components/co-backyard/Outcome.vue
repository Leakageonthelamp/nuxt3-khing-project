    <p class="mt-6">
      The Co-Backyard project is special to me because it connects with my interests and helped me
      grow my skills. I created solutions for condo communities, made 3D visuals, designed an app,
      and learned about service design and branding. These skills became the starting point for me
      to use diverse abilities in one project and improve time management, multitasking skill to
      complete everything within 4 months.
