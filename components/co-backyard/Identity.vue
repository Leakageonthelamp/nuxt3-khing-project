    <p class="mt-6">
      In many condominiums, people do not talk to each other much, and there are not many fun
      activities in shared spaces. As someone from the countryside moving to Bangkok for the first
      time, I was not used to this environment. I think it would be great to have activities that
      help people connect and build good relationships with their neighbors.
