            I began by interviewing and observing residents in my condominium, including housewives
            and neighbors. After gathering data, I grouped the residents into four main types based
            on their family status and occupations.

            To illustrate their potential for collaboration, I created a diagram inspired by the
            book “We Are All Designers,” showing different levels of participation and willingness
            to take action.

        I developed personas for condo residents interested in vegetable gardening activities,
        focusing mainly on housewives. However, I aim to create activities that are inclusive and
        allow everyone in the condo to participate in some way.
