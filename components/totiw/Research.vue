          I start by interviews with students from different faculties and universities in Bangkok
          and other provinces. This allows me to gather diverse perspectives and ensure a
          comprehensive approach to my work.

          In my interviews, I focus on studying behaviors and resource management. I inquire about
          how students learn, organize and store resources like books, summaries, exams, and lecture
          slides.

            In interviews, it was found that students in Law, Literature, Science, Engineering, and
            Health Science faculties read books more frequently.

            A problem identified was that after graduation, many students do not continue using
            knowledge resources after graduation.

          <p class="text-xl">
            By encouraging incoming students to continue using these resources for learning, it can
            greatly enhance the learning experience.
