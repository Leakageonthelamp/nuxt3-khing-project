            I focused on understanding how students manage resourcesâ€”how they learn, organize, and
            store materials like books, summaries, exams, and lecture slides.

            In interviews, it was found that students in Law, Literature, Science, Engineering, and
            Health Science faculties read books more frequently.

            A problem identified was that after graduation, many students stop using knowledge
            resources. These resources end up being wasted, left unused, collecting dust, or even
            sold as scrap paper.
          </p>
          <p>
            To address this issue, I aim to repurpose unused resources like textbooks and notes,
            making them valuable rather than leaving them idle.
