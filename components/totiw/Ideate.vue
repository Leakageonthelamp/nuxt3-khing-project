        I outline the key features for the app based on the idea of university students studying
        together at tables. The app's main page, called "To-tiw" (โต๊ะติว), will serve as a
        centralized community hub with categorized tables for different subjects. The app will
        include functions like a Directory to find tables, borrowing and exchanging books or notes,
        as well as features such as Search, Notification, Profile, Chat, and Feed to enhance the
        community experience.

        feature. This helps in organizing the features for designing the information architecture.
