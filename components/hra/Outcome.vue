    <p class="mt-6">
      This project addressed multiple pain points from both staff and patients, fueling my passion
      to ideate solutions that could truly make a difference. For staff, the goal was to reduce
      manual workload and improve efficiency with automated tools. For patients, I wanted to create
      forms that are easy, convenient, and clear, encouraging everyone to assess their health—a
      vital step for well-being.

    <p class="mt-6">
      Although the project is still in the implementation phase and hasn’t been tested in real-world
      conditions, it remains a piece of work I’m proud of and excited to present here.

          Need Testing & Feedback:
          <span class="text-black">
            Do user testing to improve the design based on real-world feedback. Testing will help
            identify issues that might not be visible during the design phase and ensure the system
            works well in real-world conditions. This feedback can guide updates to better meet user
            needs.

          Add Mobile Version:
          <span class="text-black">
            Make a mobile-friendly version so users can do the form at home. The current layout is
            designed for tablets, which might not work well on smaller screens. Adjusting the size
            and layout will make it easier for users to navigate and complete forms on their phones.

          Improve UI:
          <span class="text-black">
            Make the design easier to read, especially for elderly or visually impaired users.
            Adding features like larger fonts, better contrast, and adjustable settings can ensure
            that everyone, regardless of their age or ability, can use the app comfortably.
