        The HealthFlow ecosystem streamlines workflows in Health Tech and proactive health screening
        services. It integrates features like Authentication, Checkup, and Telemedicine,
        centralizing data to reduce repetitive tasks, improve staff efficiency, and enhance the user
        experience—making health services more convenient, faster, and easier to understand.

        My role as a Researcher and Designer involved collecting in-depth data from both users and
        staff at health stations, observing their workflows during health screening events, and
        identifying problems and needs. I led brainstorming sessions to develop solutions and
        designed wireframes for the proposed system.

          Thailand requires all citizens to do a health check every year to find their risk of
          diseases. But the paper-based system is slow, hard to use, and can have mistakes. There
          are too many forms, and it takes a long time to finish. Below is an example of the current
          paper form, which is not easy to read or fill out.
