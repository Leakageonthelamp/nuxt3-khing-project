          <p>Wireframe phase began with dividing the design into five parts:</p>
          <img src="/images/works/hra/wireframe1.png" alt="wireframe-1" class="w-full my-4" />
          <p>
            I started by sketching ideas on paper and creating quick mockups to test gestures and
            button interactions on tablets. These sketches helped refine the flow, simplify UX
            writing, and handle potential errors or empty states effectively.

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-hra-secondary text-3xl">Staff Application Wireframe</h2>
      <p class="mt-6">
        Then i start to make wireframe, prototyping, testing to compare button presses and scrolling
        for speed. The design was iteratively reviewed with the team until we arrived at the best
        version within the given timeline. I used the idea of designing all questions in the one
        page as the paper form to ensure familiarity for staff (Match between real world).

      <p class="mt-4 text-hra-secondary text-sm">This is the form interface:</p>

      <p class="mt-10 text-hra-secondary text-sm">
        And It includes additional convenience features such as:

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-hra-secondary text-3xl">Patient Application Wireframe</h2>
      <p class="mt-6">
        Using the same process as the staff application, this time the focus was on improving the
        clarity and readability of the forms. The goal was to make the questions easier to
        understand and visually accessible for all users. so it’s Displaying one question per page
        helps users focus and reduces cognitive load.

        This is more than just a questionnaire—it’s a series of cognitive tests.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-4">
        Each question required a unique design approach, unlike standard forms. The process
        involves:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-decimal list-inside">
        <li>Elderly users completing each test.</li>
        <li>Staff reviewing the results with provided answer keys or benchmarks for comparison.</li>
        <li>A final summary generated to assist staff in evaluating overall results.</li>
      </ul>

        Here are some parts of the tests that I enjoyed designing.

      <p class="mt-4">
        After finishing the Staff Wireframe, I focused on the needs of supervisors and product
        owners to see screening results. This design helps them track progress, check performance,
        and make better decisions easily.
