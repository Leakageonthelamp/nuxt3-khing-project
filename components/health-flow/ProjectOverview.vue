      The HealthFlow ecosystem streamlines workflows in Health Tech and proactive health screening
      services. It integrates features like Authentication, Checkup, and Telemedicine, centralizing
      data to reduce repetitive tasks, improve staff efficiency, and enhance the user
      experienceâ€”making health services more convenient, faster, and easier to understand.

      My role as a Researcher and Designer involved collecting in-depth data from both users and
      staff at health stations, observing their workflows during health screening events, and
      identifying problems and needs. I led brainstorming sessions to develop solutions and designed
      wireframes for the proposed system.
