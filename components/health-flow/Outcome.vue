    <p class="mt-6">
      <span class="font-medium">HealthFlow</span> was my first major project, where I spent months
      collecting data from staff and patients, resulting in over 100 slides of insights. By
      integrating features like authentication, health check management, telemedicine, and real-time
      results, HealthFlow reduces repetitive tasks, improves efficiency, and enhances user
      experiences. LineOA further enables users to access health records and book services anytime,
      anywhere. This project lays a strong foundation for future product a strong foundation for
      future product development and offers scalable solutions to meet diverse client needs.

            Improving HealthTech Environment: While another team handles the physical setup,
            aligning the environment with HealthFlow’s workflow could improve efficiency. Designing

            Improve features like queue management and equipment handling to match real-world
            operations. Since this is a large system and hasn’t been tested yet, the current
            presentation serves as an initial concept that still needs significant adjustments and
            improvements.
