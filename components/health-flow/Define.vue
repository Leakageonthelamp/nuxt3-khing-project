      <p class="mt-6">
        We began by mapping user data into a User Journey Map, detailing activities, touchpoints,
        pain points, and opportunities. This allowed us to visualize the entire workflow and
        identify key problem areas effectively.

        Additionally, We also observed and took photos at the locations to check the environment and
        how items were stored. This helped us see if the setup was good enough or if any adjustments
        were needed for improvement.Â

              We also created a spaghetti mapping to show where staff and users moved around or
              waited during their time at the location. This revealed significant issues with space
              management that needed to be addressed.

            The movement patterns showed problems with space use, like paths crossing too much or no
            clear waiting areas.

        After analyzing the, we found three main problems: Staff deal with repetitive tasks and
        confusing tools, making workflows slow. Crowded spaces and messy tools make work harder.
        Patients face long waits, unclear processes, and poor communication.
