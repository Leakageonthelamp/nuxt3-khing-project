      After analyzing the problems and user needs, our team brainstormed and presented solutions to
      other teams and executives. The result...

      What if everything could come together in one system?

      We designed <span class="text-healthflow-secondary font-medium">HealthFlow</span>, a platform
      that combines all key features into
      <span class="text-healthflow-secondary font-medium">one place</span>—Authentication, CheckUp,
      Telemedicine, Appointments, Medical Certificates, and Health Reports—to address the staff
      challenges we identified.

          For <span class="text-healthflow-secondary font-medium">users</span>, we developed a
          <span class="text-healthflow-secondary font-medium">Line OA</span> to deliver health
          results, keep them informed about their health, and connect them with ongoing healthcare
          services. This will later evolve into a mobile app for better convenience and long-term
          engagement.

          For <span class="text-healthflow-secondary font-medium">staff</span>, we designed the
          <span class="text-healthflow-secondary font-medium">HealthFlow back-office</span> to make
          their work more efficient. The system helps staff manage daily tasks, monitor device
          statuses, troubleshoot problems, handle queues, and oversee health services and stock
          levels. By centralizing these functions in one platform, HealthFlow
