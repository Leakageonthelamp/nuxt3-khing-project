        Designing took a lot of time because there were many parts to work on. We started with the
        <span class="text-healthflow-secondary font-medium">staff back-office</span>, as it is the
        first step when setting up devices and starting services. Then, we followed the process step
        by step, designing each part until the service was complete.
      </p>
      <p class="text-healthflow-secondary mt-6">
        As a UX designer, I was responsible for creating all the wireframes for this project,
        ensuring every flow and function was user-friendly. While the UI was developed by my
        teammates, I actively reviewed and provided guidance to ensure the design aligned with the
        usability and goals set in the wireframes.

      <p class="mt-6">
        LineOA is a small, separate project we created to let users connect with HealthFlow from
        anywhere, aligning with the objectives mentioned earlier. For this part, I designed the UI
        version myself, as it was not too complex. The graphics team handled the creation of the
        rich menu.
      </p>
      <p class="text-healthflow-secondary mt-6">
        This project relied on UX writing to ensure that responses in LineOA were polite yet not
        overly formal. Careful attention was given to tone and gender selection, with a focus on
        using feminine terms, as all HealthTech staff are female.
